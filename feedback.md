 - Overall, very nice UI
	 - Reminded me a lot of a postman work enviroment so felt very simple to interact with
	 - Colors are nice
	 - Side bar and making request was inuitive from graphics 
 - UX
	 - It wasn't inutitive to me at first that I had to pass the method name to make the request, but after I figured that out it became very easy to use
	 - It was really annoying making a new request method while I was inside a collection and the request making an entirely new collection
	 - It'd be nice to include a link to the contract
 - Bugs
	 - The web app would crash at times when I was creating new collections/ requests with empty names
	 - Sometimes when i imported the default ERC 20 requests the website would crash when I clicked other requests

Overall, I would definaltey use a tool like this and would love to stay updated
